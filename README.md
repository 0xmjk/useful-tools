* http://semaja2.net/ye-ol-projects/insomniaxinfo/ - InsomniaX prevents Mac Book Pro from sleeping - doesn't fully work on High Sierra apparently though:
```
# sudo kextload /Applications/InsomniaX.app/Contents/Resources/Insomnia_r11.kext
/Applications/InsomniaX.app/Contents/Resources/Insomnia_r11.kext failed to load - (libkern/kext) system policy prevents loading; check the system/kernel logs for errors or try kextutil(8).
```
